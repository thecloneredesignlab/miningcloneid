The patients were treated with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as part of the ARTEMIS trial (NCT02276443). Specifically, the therapies included:
Therapies Used:
Anthracycline + Cyclophosphamide (AC):
Given first in the neoadjuvant sequence.
Regimen typically included doxorubicin or epirubicin + cyclophosphamide.
Taxane:
Followed AC therapy in the neoadjuvant setting.
Most commonly paclitaxel or docetaxel.
These regimens represent standard-of-care neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage TNBC.
Treatment Timing:
Tumor samples were collected:
Pre-treatment (baseline biopsy),
Mid-treatment (after AC, before taxane), and
Post-treatment (after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, typically during surgery).
